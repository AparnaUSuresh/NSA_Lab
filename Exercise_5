1)Write a shell script that takes a command line argument and reports on
whether it is directory, a file, or something else.


printf "\nEnter a directory /file path";
read value;
if [ -d $value ]
 then
   echo "$value is a directory"
elif [ -f $value ]
 then 
    echo "$value is a file"
else 
  echo " $value is not valid"
fi 


2) Write a shell script that computes the gross salary of a employee according
to the following rules :
i) if basic salary is < 1500 then HRA =10% of the basic and DA =90% of the basic.
ii) If basic salary is >=1500 then HRA =Rs500 and DA=98% of the basic.


printf "\n Enter the salary\n";
read sal;
if (($sal<1500))
then
echo "$(($sal+($sal*10/100)+($sal*90/100)))";
else
echo "$(($sal+500+($sal*98/100)))";
fi

3)Write a shell script that accepts two integers as its arguments and
computes the value of first number raised to the power of the second
number.
#!/bin/bash
echo "First number";
read n1;
echo " ";
echo "Second number";
read n2;
echo " ";
echo "$n1^$n2 is=$(($n1**$n2))";

4)Write a shell script which receives two file names as arguments. It should
check whether the two file contents are same or not. If they are same then
second file should be deleted.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter file1";
read f1;
echo "Enter file2";
read f2;
if ( diff $f1 $f2)
then 
rm -i $f2
else
echo "Different files";
fi

5)Write a shell script for Calculator
#!/bin/bash
printf "\n1.Add\n2.Sub\n3.Multiply\n4.Divide\n5.Exit";
echo "Enter choice ";
read opt;
echo "First number:";
read n1
echo "second number:";
read n2
if [ $opt = "1" ]
then
echo $((n1+n2))
elif [ $opt = "2" ]
then
echo $((n1-n2))
elif [ $opt = "3" ]
then
echo $((n1*n2))
elif [ $opt = "4" ]
then
echo $((n1/n2))
fi
exit 0
